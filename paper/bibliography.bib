	abstract = {Many hot Jupiters (HJs) are detected by the Doppler and transit techniques. From surveys using these two techniques, however, the measured HJ occurrence rates differ by a factor of two or more. Using the California Planet Survey sample and the Kepler sample, we
investigate the causes for this difference in the HJ occurrence rate. First, we find that 12.8\% ± 0.24\% of HJs are misidentified in the Kepler mission because of photometric dilution and subgiant
contamination. Second, we explore the differences between the Doppler sample and the Kepler sample that can account for the different HJ occurrence rate. Third, we discuss how to measure the fundamental HJ occurrence rates by synthesizing the results from the Doppler and Kepler surveys. The fundamental HJ occurrence rates are measures of the HJ occurrence rate as a function of stellar multiplicity and evolutionary stage, e.g., the HJ occurrence rate for single and multiple stars or for main-sequence and subgiant stars. While we find qualitative evidence that HJs occur less frequently in subgiants and multiple stellar systems, we conclude that our current knowledge of stellar properties and the stellar multiplicity rate is too limited for us to reach any quantitative result for the fundamental HJ occurrence rates. This concern extends to ηEarth, the occurrence rate of
Earth-like planets.},

    the original Kepler field. Part of the data were obtained under the Kepler 
    imaging follow-up observation program over six years (2009–2015). Almost 
    90\% of stars that are hosts to planet candidates or confirmed planets 
    were observed. We combine measurements of companions to KOI host stars 
    from different bands to create a comprehensive catalog of projected 
    separations, position angles, and magnitude differences for all detected 
    companion stars (some of which may not be bound). Our compilation includes 
    2297 companions around 1903 primary stars. From high-resolution imaging, 
    we find that ∼10\% (∼30\%) of the observed stars have at least one 
    companion detected within 1″ (4″). The true fraction of systems with close 
    (≲4″) companions is larger than the observed one due to the limited 
    sensitivities of the imaging data. We derive correction factors for planet 
    radii caused by the dilution of the transit depth: assuming that planets 
    orbit the primary stars or the brightest companion stars, the average 
    correction factors are 1.06 and 3.09, respectively. The true effect of 
    transit dilution lies in between these two cases and varies with each

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10810},
	abstract = {A new piece of evidence supporting the photoevaporation-driven evolution model for low-mass, close-in exoplanets was recently presented by the California Kepler Survey. The radius distribution of Kepler planets inwards of 100 days is shown to be clearly bimodal, with a valley separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. Such an "evaporation-valley" had been predicted by numerical models previously. Here, we use a simple analytical model to reproduce the earlier numerical results and to demonstrate that this valley results from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the longest for those planets with He/He-rich envelopes that, while only a few percent in weight, swell their sizes by a factor of two. The timescale falls for envelopes lighter than this because, as the envelope becomes more tenuous, the planet's radius remains largely constant and so does the photo-evaporating flux it receives. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the planet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation, therefore, herds planets into either bare cores (\${\textbackslash}sim\$1.3 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$), or those with double the core radius (\${\textbackslash}sim\$2.6 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$). This fact explains both the observed valley and the steep fall-off of planets above 2.6 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. The observed radius distribution further requires that the Kepler planets are clustered around 3 M\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ in mass, are endowed at birth with H/He envelopes more than a few percent in mass, and that their cores are uniformly similar to the Earth in composition. Such envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks, as opposed to being outgassed, while the core composition indicates planet assembly inward of the ice-line. Lastly, photoevaporation cannot produce bare planets beyond \${\textbackslash}sim50\$ days. If such planets are present, they could indicate a second channel for planet formation.},

	abstract = {Stellar multiplicity is a ubiquitous outcome of the star-formation process. The frequency and main characteristics of multiple systems, and their dependence on primary mass and environment, are powerful tools to probe this process. Although early attempts were fraught with selection biases and limited completeness, instrumentation breakthroughs in the past two decades now enable robust statistical analyses. In this review, we summarize current empirical knowledge of stellar multiplicity for main sequence stars and brown dwarfs, as well as among populations of pre-main-sequence stars and embedded protostars. Among field objects, the multiplicity rate and breadth of the orbital period distribution are steep functions of the primary mass, whereas the mass ratio distribution is essentially flat for most populations other than the lowest mass objects. The time-variation of the frequency of visual companions follows two parallel, constant tracks corresponding to loose and dense stellar populations, although current observations do not yet distinguish whether initial multiplicity properties are universal or dependent on the physical conditions of the parent cloud. Nonetheless, these quantitative trends provide a rich comparison basis for numerical and analytical models of star formation.},

    abstract = {We analyze the properties of searches devoted to finding planetary 
    transits by observing simple stellar systems, such as globular clusters, open 
    clusters, and the Galactic bulge. We develop the analytic tools necessary to 
    predict the number of planets that a survey will detect as a function of the 
    parameters of the system (age, extinction, distance, richness, mass function), the 
    observational setup (nights observed, bandpass, exposure time, telescope diameter, 
    detector characteristics), site properties (seeing, sky background), and the planet 
    properties (frequency, period, and radius). We find that for typical parameters, 
    the detection probability is maximized for I-band observations. At fixed planet 
    period and radius, the signal-to-noise ratio of a planetary transit in the I band 
    is weakly dependent on the mass of the primary for sources with flux above the sky 
    background and falls very sharply for sources below sky. Therefore, for typical 
    targets, the number of detectable planets is roughly proportional to the number of 
    stars with transiting planets with fluxes above sky (and not necessarily the number 
    of sources with photometric error less than a given threshold).
    Furthermore, for rising mass functions, the majority of the planets will be 
    detected around sources with fluxes near sky. In order to maximize the number of 
    detections, experiments should therefore be tailored such that sources near sky are 
    above the required detection threshold. Once this requirement is met, the number of 
    detected planets is relatively weakly dependent on the detection threshold, 
    diameter of the telescope, exposure time, seeing, age of the system, and planet 
    radius, for typical ranges of these parameters encountered in current transit 
    searches in stellar systems. The number of detected planets is a strongly 
    decreasing function of the distance to the system, implying that the nearest, 
    richest clusters may prove to be optimal targets.},

    false positive candidate transiting exoplanets discovered by the Kepler mission,

    range from R = 8 to 16 and our observations attempt to provide background 
    non-detection limits 5-6 mag fainter and binary separations of 
    {\textasciitilde}0.05-2.0 arcsec. We present data describing the relative 
    brightness, separation, and position angles for secondary sources, as well as 
    relative plate limits for non-detection of faint nearby stars around each of 156 
    target stars. Faint neighbors were found near 10 of the stars.},

    appear smaller than it really is, or produce a false-positive detection when the

    spatial-resolution adaptive optics images of 90 Kepler planetary candidates. 
    Companion stars are detected as close as 0farcs1 from the target star. Images were 
    taken in the near-infrared (J and Ks bands) with ARIES on the MMT and PHARO on the 
    Palomar Hale 200 inch telescope. Most objects (60\%) have at least one star within 
    6'' separation and a magnitude difference of 9. Eighteen objects (20\%) have at 
    least one companion within 2'' of the target star; six companions (7\%) are closer 
    than 0farcs5. Most of these companions were previously unknown, and the associated 
    planetary candidates should receive
    additional scrutiny. Limits are placed on the presence of additional companions for 
    every system observed, which can be used to validate planets statistically using 
    the BLENDER method. Validation is
    particularly critical for low-mass, potentially Earth-like worlds, which are not 
    detectable with current-generation radial velocity techniques. High-resolution 
    images are thus a crucial component of any transit follow-up program.

    revolution by discovering thousands of new planet candidates. However, a
    follow-up program is needed to reject false candidates and fully
    characterize the bona-fide exoplanets. Aims: Our main aims are to
    1./ detect and analyze close companions inside the typical Kepler point
    spread function (PSF) to study whether they are the responsible for the
    dimming found in Kepler light curves, 2./ study the change in the
    stellar and planetary parameters caused by an unresolved object, 3./

    planet-host candidates. Such a large sample of observed planet-host
    candidates allows us to derive statistics for close (visual or bounded)
    companions to the harboring star. Methods: We present lucky
    imaging observations for a total of 98 KOIs. This technique is based on
    the acquisition of thousands of very-short-exposure-time images. A
    selection and combination of a small amount of the highest quality
    frames provides a high resolution image with objects having a 0.1 arcsec
    PSF. We apply this technique to carry out observations in the Sloan i
    and z filters of our Kepler candidates. Results: We find blended
    objects inside the Kepler PSF for a significant percentage of KOIs. On
    the one hand, only 58.2\% of the hosts do not have any object within 6
    arcsec. On the other hand, we find 19 companions closer than 3 arcsec in
    17 KOIs. According to their magnitudes and i - z colors, 8 of them could

    abstract = {Context. The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of planet 
    candidates. Currently, some of them have already been discarded; more
    than 200 have been confirmed by follow-up observations (most by radial
    velocity and few by other methods), and several hundreds have been
    validated. However, the large majority of the candidates are still
    awaiting for confirmation. Thus, priorities (in terms of the probability
    of the candidate being a real planet) must be established for subsequent
    radial velocity observations. Aims: The motivation of this work
    is to provide a set of isolated (good) host candidates to be further
    tested by other techniques that allow confirmation of the planet. As a
    complementary goal, we aim to identify close companions of the
    candidates that could have contaminated the light curve of the planet
    host due to the large pixel size of the Kepler CCD and its typical PSF
    of around 6 arcsec. Both goals can also provide robust statistics about
    the multiplicity of the Kepler hosts. Methods: We used the
    AstraLux North instrument located at the 2.2 m telescope in the Calar
    Alto Observatory (Almería, Spain) to obtain diffraction-limited
    images of 174 Kepler objects of interest. A sample of demoted Kepler
    objects of interest (with rejected planet candidates) is used as a
    control for comparison of multiplicity statistics. The lucky-imaging
    technique used in this work is compared to other adaptive optics and
    speckle imaging observations of Kepler planet host candidates. To that
    end, we define a new parameter, the blended source confidence level
    (BSC), to assess the probability of an object to have blended
    non-detected eclipsing binaries capable of producing the detected
    transit. Results: We find that 67.2\% of the observed Kepler hosts
    are isolated within our detectability limits, and 32.8\% have at least
    one visual companion at angular separations below 6 arcsec. Indeed, we
    find close companions (below 3 arcsec) for the 17.2\% of the sample. The
    planet properties of this sample of non-isolated hosts are revised
    according to the presence of such close companions. We report one
    possible S-type binary (KOI-3158), where the five planet candidates
    would orbit one of the components of the system. We also report three
    possible false positives (KOIs 1230.01, 3649.01, and 3886.01) due to the
    presence of close companions that modify candidate properties such that
    they cannot be considered as planets anymore. The BSC parameter is
    calculated for all the isolated targets and compared to both the value
    prior to any high-resolution image and, when possible, to observations
    from previous high-spatial resolution surveys in the Kepler sample.

    abstract = {High-resolution ground-based optical speckle and near-infrared adaptive 
    optics images are taken to search for stars in close angular proximity
    to host stars of candidate planets identified by the NASA Kepler
    Mission. Neighboring stars are a potential source of false positive
    signals. These stars also blend into Kepler light curves, affecting
    estimated planet properties, and are important for an understanding of
    planets in multiple star systems. Deep images with high angular
    resolution help to validate candidate planets by excluding potential
    background eclipsing binaries as the source of the transit signals. A
    study of 18 Kepler Object of Interest stars hosting a total of 28
    candidate and validated planets is presented. Validation levels are
    determined for 18 planets against the likelihood of a false positive
    from a background eclipsing binary. Most of these are validated at the
    99\% level or higher, including five newly validated planets in two
    systems: Kepler-430 and Kepler-431. The stellar properties of the
    candidate host stars are determined by supplementing existing literature
    values with new spectroscopic characterizations. Close neighbors of
    seven of these stars are examined using multi-wavelength photometry to
    determine their nature and influence on the candidate planet properties.
    Most of the close neighbors appear to be gravitationally bound
    secondaries, while a few are best explained as closely co-aligned field
    stars. Revised planet properties are derived for each candidate and
    validated planet, including cases where the close neighbors are the
    potential host stars.},

    Results include detections, exclusion of background stars that could be
    a source of false positives for the transits, and detection of
    physically associated companions in a number of cases providing dilution
    measures necessary for planet parameter refinement. For six Kepler
    objects of interest, we find that there is ambiguity regarding which
    star hosts the transiting planet(s), with potentially strong
    implications for planetary characteristics. Our sample is evenly
    distributed in G, K, and M spectral types. Albeit with a small sample
    size, we find that physically associated binaries are more common than
    expected at each spectral type, reaching a factor of 10 frequency excess
    in M. We document the program detection sensitivities, detections, and
    deliverables to the Kepler follow-up program archive.

    responsible for the relatively high probability of false-positive
    exoplanet detections and that cause underestimates of the size of
    transit radii. Our comprehensive survey will also shed light on the
    effects of stellar multiplicity on exoplanet properties and will
    identify rare exoplanetary architectures. In this second part of our
    ongoing survey, we observed an additional 969 Kepler planet candidate
    hosts and we report blended stellar companions up to \{\{Δ \}\}m≈ 6
    that contribute to Kepler's measured light curves. We found 203
    companions within ˜4″ of 181 of the Kepler stars, of which

    be orbited by planetary mass companions (almost all known targets), as
    well as for a volume-limited sample of 41 stars not known to host any
    planet. For most of the stars the stellar parameters are revised
    versions of the ones presented in our previous work. However, we also
    present parameters for 18 stars with planets not previously published,
    and a compilation of stellar parameters for the remaining 4 planet-hosts
    for which we could not obtain a spectrum. A comparison of our stellar
    parameters with values of Teff, log g, and [Fe/H] available
    in the literature shows a remarkable agreement. In particular, our
    spectroscopic log g values are now very close to trigonometric log g
    estimates based on Hipparcos parallaxes. The derived [Fe/H] values are
    then used to confirm the previously known result that planets are more
    prevalent around metal-rich stars. Furthermore, we confirm that the
    frequency of planets is a strongly rising function of the stellar
    metallicity, at least for stars with [Fe/H] {\textgreater} 0. While only about 3\%
    of the solar metallicity stars in the CORALIE planet search sample were
    found to be orbited by a planet, this number increases to more than 25\%
    for stars with [Fe/H] above +0.3. Curiously, our results also suggest
    that these percentages might remain relatively constant for values of
    [Fe/H] lower than about solar, increasing then linearly with the mass
    fraction of heavy elements. These results are discussed in the context
    of the theories of planetary formation.

    \${\textbackslash}approx 2{\textasciitilde}R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. 
    Such a valley was observed recently, owing to an improvement in the 
    precision of stellar, and therefore planetary radii. Here we investigate 
    the presence, location and shape of such a valley using a small sample 
    with highly accurate stellar parameters determined from asteroseismology, 
    which includes 117 planets with a median uncertainty on the radius of 
    3.3\%. We detect a clear bimodal distribution, with super-Earths

    and sub-Neptunes (\${\textbackslash}approx 
    2.5{\textasciitilde}R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$) separated by a deficiency

    a slope of opposite sign. The exact location of the gap further points to

    derived planetary radii for Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs). The
    current production of the KOI list assumes that each KOI is a single
    star. Not accounting for stellar multiplicity statistically biases the
    planets toward smaller radii. The bias toward smaller radii depends on
    the properties of the companion stars and whether the planets orbit the
    primary or the companion stars. Defining a planetary radius correction
    factor, XR, we find that if the KOIs are assumed to be
    single, then, on average, the planetary radii may be underestimated by a
    factor of {\textless} \{\{X\}R\}{\textgreater} ≈ 1.5. If typical radial
    velocity and high-resolution imaging observations are performed and no
    companions are detected, then this factor reduces to {\textless}
    \{\{X\}R\}{\textgreater} ≈ 1.2. The correction factor {\textless}
    \{\{X\}R\}{\textgreater} is dependent on the primary star properties and
    ranges from {\textless} \{\{X\}R\}{\textgreater} ≈ 1.6 for A and F stars to
    {\textless} \{\{X\}R\}{\textgreater} ≈ 1.2 for K and M stars. For missions 
    like
    K2 and TESS where the stars may be closer than the stars in the Kepler
    target sample, observational vetting (primary imaging) reduces the
    radius correction factor to {\textless} \{\{X\}R\}{\textgreater} ≈ 1.1.
    Finally, we show that if the stellar multiplicity rates are not
    accounted for correctly, then occurrence rate calculations for
    Earth-sized planets may overestimate the frequency of small planets by
    as much as 15\%-20\%.},

    with Keplerian orbit fits to the data. This allows us to understand the
    detection threshold for each star in terms of the number and time
    baseline of the observations, and the underlying “noise”
    from measurement errors, intrinsic stellar jitter, or additional
    low-mass planets. We show that all planets with orbital periods P

    2000 days, velocity amplitudes K {\textgreater} 20 m s-1, and
    eccentricities e ≲ 0.6 have been announced, and we summarize the

    remaining stars, we calculate upper limits on the velocity amplitude of
    a companion. For orbital periods less than the duration of the
    observations, these are typically 10 m s-1 and increase
    ∝ P2 for longer periods. We then use the nondetections

    sample and the precision achieved with HARPS have allowed the detection
    of a sufficiently large number of low-mass planets to study the
    statistical properties of their orbital elements, the correlation of the
    host-star metallicity with the planet masses, as well as the occurrence
    rate of planetary systems around solar-type stars. A robust estimate of
    the frequency of systems shows that more than 50\% of solar-type stars
    harbor at least one planet of any mass and with period up to 100 days.
    Different properties are observed for the population of planets less
    massive than about 30M-Earth compared to the population of gaseous giant
    planets. The mass distribution of Super-Earths and Neptune-mass planets
    (SEN) is strongly increasing between 30 and 15M-Earth. The SEN occurence
    rate does not exhibit a preference for metal rich stars. Most of the SEN
    planets belong to multi-planetary systems. The orbital eccentricities of
    the SEN planets seems limited to 0.45. At the opposite, the occurence
    rate of gaseous giant planets is growing with the logarithm of the
    period, and is strongly increasing with the host-star metallicity. About
    14\% of solar-type stars have a planetary companion more massive than
    50M-Earth? on an orbit with a period shorter than 10 years. Orbital
    eccentricities of giant planets are observed up to 0.9 and beyond. The
    precision of HARPS-type spectrographs opens the possibility to detect
    planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars. Identification of a
    significant number of super-Earths orbiting solar-type of the Sun

	abstract = {We analyze the effect of companion stars on the bulk density of 29 planets orbiting 15 stars in the Kepler field. These stars have at least one stellar companion within 2", and the planets have measured masses and radii, allowing an estimate of their bulk density. The transit dilution by the companion star requires the planet radii to be revised upward, even if the planet orbits the primary star; as a consequence, the planetary bulk density decreases. We find that, if planets orbited a faint companion star, they would be more volatile-rich, and in several cases their densities would become unrealistically low, requiring large, inflated atmospheres or unusually large mass fractions in a H/He envelope. In addition, for planets detected in radial velocity data, the primary star has to be the host. We can exclude 14 planets from orbiting the companion star; the remaining 15 planets in seven planetary systems could orbit either the primary or the secondary star, and for five of these planets the decrease in density would be substantial even if they orbited the primary, since the companion is of almost equal brightness as the primary. Substantial follow-up work is required in order to accurately determine the radii of transiting planets. Of particular interest are small, rocky planets that may be habitable; a lower mean density might imply a more volatile-rich composition. Reliable radii, masses, and thus bulk densities will allow us to identify which small planets are truly Earth-like.},

populating the line of sight with stars drawn from the Hipparcos

sensitivity to HJs and VHJs is only 5-16\% of those in the OGLE-III
fields satisfying the spectroscopic-follow-up limit of V\_max {\textless} 17.5
mag. Hence, the frequencies we derive are much higher than a naive
estimate would indicate. We find that at 90\% confidence the fraction of
stars with planets in the two period ranges is (1/320)(1{\textasciicircum}+1.37\_-0.59)
for HJs and (1/710)(1{\textasciicircum}+1.10\_-0.54) for VHJs. The HJ rate is
statistically indistinguishable from that found in radial velocity (RV)
studies. However, we note that magnitude-limited RV samples are heavily
biased toward metal-rich (hence, planet-bearing) stars, while transit
surveys are not, and therefore we expect that more sensitive transit
surveys should find a deficit of HJs as compared to RV surveys. The
detection of three transiting VHJs, all with periods less than 2 days,
is marginally consistent with the complete absence of such detections in
RV surveys. The planets detected are consistent with being uniformly
distributed between 1.00 and 1.25 Jovian radii, but there are too few in
the sample to map this distribution in detail.},

metallicity, there is a smooth and rapid rise in the fraction of stars with planets. At [Fe/H]{\textgreater}+0.3 dex, 25\% of observed stars have detected gas giant planets. A power-law fit to these data relates the formation probability for gas giant planets to the square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar metallicity also appears to be correlated with the presence of multiple-planet systems and with the total detected planet mass. This data set was examined to better understand the origin of high metallicity in stars with planets. None of the expected fossil
signatures of accretion are observed in stars with planets relative to the general sample: (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2) subgiants with planets do not show dilution of metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si, Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation temperature, and (4) no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or
eccentricity could be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar planets do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from other stars; more likely, they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular clouds.

Based on observations obtained at Lick and Keck Observatories, operated by the University of California, and the Anglo-Australian Observatories.},

	abstract = {The occurrence rate of hot Jupiters from the Kepler transit survey is 
roughly half that of radial velocity surveys targeting solar
neighborhood stars. One hypothesis to explain this difference is that
the two surveys target stars with different stellar metallicity
distributions. To test this hypothesis, we measure the metallicity
distribution of the Kepler targets using the Hectochelle multi-fiber,
high-resolution spectrograph. Limiting our spectroscopic analysis to 610
dwarf stars in our sample with \{log\}g {\textgreater} 3.5, we measure a metallicity
distribution characterized by a mean of
\{[\{\{M\}\}/\{\{H\}\}]\}\{mean\}=-0.045+/- 0.009, in agreement with
previous studies of the Kepler field target stars. In comparison, the
metallicity distribution of the California Planet Search radial velocity
sample has a mean of \{[\{\{M\}\}/\{\{H\}\}]\}\{CPS,\{mean\}\}=-0.005+/-
0.006, and the samples come from different parent populations according
to a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We refit the exponential relation
between the fraction of stars hosting a close-in giant planet and the
host star metallicity using a sample of dwarf stars from the California
Planet Search with updated metallicities. The best-fit relation tells us
that the difference in metallicity between the two samples is
insufficient to explain the discrepant hot Jupiter occurrence rates; the
metallicity difference would need to be ≃0.2-0.3 dex for
perfect agreement. We also show that (sub)giant contamination in the
Kepler sample cannot reconcile the two occurrence calculations. We
conclude that other factors, such as binary contamination and imperfect
stellar properties, must also be at play.},

This maximum likelihood method accommodates more than one planet per star and any number of planet or target star properties. We apply the method to announced Kepler planet candidates that transit solar-type stars. The Kepler team's estimates of the detection efficiency are used and are shown to agree with theoretical predictions for an ideal transit survey. The PLDF is fit to a joint power law in planet radius, down to 0.5 R ⊕ , and orbital period, up to 50 days. The estimated number of planets per star in this sample is 0.7-1.4, where the range covers systematic uncertainties in the detection efficiency. To analyze trends in the PLDF we consider four planet samples, divided between shorter and longer periods at 7 days and between large and small radii at 3 R ⊕ . The size distribution changes appreciably between these four samples, revealing a relative deficit of 3 R ⊕ planets at the shortest periods. This deficit is suggestive of preferential evaporation and sublimation of Neptune- and Saturn-like planets. If the trend and explanation hold, it would be spectacular observational support of the core accretion and migration hypotheses, and would allow refinement of these theories.},

We found 603 planets, including 10 that are Earth size (1-2 Earth-radii) and receive
comparable levels of stellar energy to that of Earth (within a factor of four). We account for Kepler's imperfect detectability of such planets by injecting synthetic planet-caused dimmings into the Kepler brightness measurements and recording the fraction detected. We find that
11±4\% of Sun-like stars harbor an Earth-size planet receiving
between one and four times the stellar intensity as Earth. We also find that the occurrence of Earth-size planets is constant with increasing orbital period (P), within equal intervals of logP up to ˜200 d.

We verify the integrity of the stellar parameters through comparisons with asteroseismic studies and Gaia parallaxes. We also recompute planetary radii for 2025 planet candidates. Because knowledge of planetary radii is often limited by uncertainties in stellar size, we improve the uncertainties in planet radii from typically 42\% to 11\%.

	abstract = {The California-Kepler Survey (CKS) is an observational program to improve our knowledge of the properties of stars found to host transiting planets by NASA's Kepler Mission. The improvement stems from new high-resolution optical spectra obtained using HIRES at the W. M. Keck Observatory. The CKS stellar sample comprises 1305 stars classified as Kepler Objects of Interest, hosting a total of 2075 transiting planets. The primary sample is magnitude-limited (Kp {\textless} 14.2) and contains 960 stars with 1385 planets. The sample was extended to include some fainter stars that host multiple planets, ultra short period planets, or habitable zone planets. The spectroscopic parameters were determined with two different codes, one based on template matching and the other on direct spectral synthesis using radiative transfer. We demonstrate a precision of 60 K in effective temperature, 0.07 dex in surface gravity, 0.04 dex in [Fe/H], and 1.0 km/s in projected rotational velocity. In this paper we describe the CKS project and present a uniform catalog of spectroscopic parameters. Subsequent papers in this series present catalogs of derived stellar properties such as mass, radius and age; revised planet properties; and statistical explorations of the ensemble. CKS is the largest survey to determine the properties of Kepler stars using a uniform set of high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra.

	abstract = {HATSouth is the world's first network of automated and homogeneous telescopes that is capable of year-round 24 hr monitoring of positions over an entire hemisphere of the sky. The primary scientific goal of the network is to discover and characterize a large number of transiting extrasolar planets, reaching out to long periods and down to small planetary radii. HATSouth achieves this by monitoring extended areas on the sky, deriving high precision light curves for a large number of stars, searching for the signature of planetary transits, and confirming planetary candidates with larger telescopes. HATSouth employs six telescope units spread over three prime locations with large longitude separation in the southern hemisphere (Las Campanas Observatory, Chile; HESS site, Namibia; Siding Spring Observatory, Australia). Each of the HATSouth units holds four 0.18 m diameter f /2.8 focal ratio telescope tubes on a common mount producing an 8.2° × 8.2° field of view on the sky, imaged using four 4 K × 4 K CCD cameras and Sloan r filters, to give a pixel scale of 3.7” pixel -1 . The HATSouth network is capable of continuously monitoring 128 square arc degrees at celestial positions moderately close to the anti-solar direction. We present the technical details of the network, summarize operations, and present detailed weather statistics for the three sites. Robust operations have meant that on average each of the six HATSouth units has conducted observations on 500 nights over a 2 years time period, yielding a total of more than 1 million science frames at a 4 minute integration time and observing 10.65 hr day -1 on average. We describe the scheme of our data transfer and reduction from raw pixel images to trend-filtered light curves and transiting planet candidates. Photometric precision reaches 6 mmag at 4 minute cadence for the brightest non-saturated stars at r \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] ≈ 10.5. We present detailed transit recovery simulations to determine the expected yield of transiting planets from HATSouth. We highlight the advantages of networked operations, namely, a threefold increase in the expected number of detected planets, as compared to all telescopes operating from the same site.},

	abstract = {The planet occurrence rate for multiple stars is important in two 
aspects. First, almost half of stellar systems in the solar neighborhood
are multiple systems. Second, the comparison of the planet occurrence
rate for multiple stars to that for single stars sheds light on the
influence of stellar multiplicity on planet formation and evolution. We
developed a method of distinguishing planet occurrence rates for single
and multiple stars. From a sample of 138 bright (KP {\textless}
13.5) Kepler multi-planet candidate systems, we compared the stellar
multiplicity rate of these planet host stars to that of field stars.
Using dynamical stability analyses and archival Doppler measurements, we
find that the stellar multiplicity rate of planet host stars is
significantly lower than field stars for semimajor axes less than 20 AU,
suggesting that planet formation and evolution are suppressed by the
presence of a close-in companion star at these separations. The
influence of stellar multiplicity at larger separations is uncertain
because of search incompleteness due to a limited Doppler observation
time baseline and a lack of high-resolution imaging observation. We
calculated the planet confidence for the sample of multi-planet
candidates and find that the planet confidences for KOI 82.01, KOI
115.01, KOI 282.01, and KOI 1781.02 are higher than 99.7\% and thus
validate the planetary nature of these four planet candidates. This
sample of bright Kepler multi-planet candidates with refined stellar and
orbital parameters, planet confidence estimation, and nearby stellar
companion identification offers a well-characterized sample for future
theoretical and observational study.},
